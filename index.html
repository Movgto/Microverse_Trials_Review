                Metroid Dread had become a near-mythic game,
                a fabled DS entry that never saw the light of day by
                the time it was announced at E3 2021 as a Switch game.
            <p />
            <p>
                With nearly 20 years having passed since the last new 2D
                Metroid, expectations were sky high. Fortunately for fans,
                Dread met (and in many cases surpassed) expectations for
                what a modern 2D Metroid game could accomplish.
